pycic: Python client for CIC_
=============================

``pycic`` is an MIT_ licensed client, written in Python, that lets you interact with the CIC_ (Centro de Integraci√≥n Ciudadana) API.

``pycic`` currently works with the ``nl`` and ``sal`` accounts. You might notice that ``nl`` is the default account, but you can change quickly that behavior at the moment of the instance creation, for example: ``Report(account="sal")``.
